# Piezoelectric-parameter-characterized-by-PSO

This algorithm is using PSO to characterize the parameter of piezoelectric material measured by impedance analyser.

It contents two algorithms PSO and simulated annealing.

The dataset and results are in the "data" directory.

The "Butterworth" is a filter to preprocess the origin data.

test


Run "main_epoxy_pso6input2.m" to see the result calculate by PSO or "Optimization_Problem_Simulated_Annealing.m" by simulated annealing.(data load path may change accordingly)
